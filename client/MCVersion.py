# There are lots more parameters in the version json file that this
# class doesn't handle. We really should rewrite it to handle
# everthing in there more generally.
# But need to find where to get all the variables used in those json
# files.

# The json at ~/.minecraft/versions/version_manifest_v2.json has info on all the
# different Minecraft versions available. Specifically, it gives where to
# download a json file for each version, and this json tells you the rest
# you need to know.

# Each of those version-specific json files is placed under
# ~/.minecraft/versions/<version>/<version>.json
# The version-specific jsons tell you many of the other things needed for that
# version to run, including a whole lot of other jar libraries that you should
# download and put under ~/.minecraft/libraries at the paths they individually
# specify.

# TODO
# There should also be a ~/.minecraft/versions/<version>/<version>.jar
# I don't know where you download that from.

# The json file which defines everything for this Minecraft version
# also has URLs and sha1 hashes for downloading each jar file if it doesn't
# exist.
# This class should download any such files that aren't already downloaded.

# OptiFine versions are different in a few ways.
# They do specify a few jars needed, but usually don't include
# download URLs and hashes; the file has to already exist, or else
# it won't work.
# OptiFine versions also usually inherit from the official Minecraft versions,
# so there needs to be a facility for detecting inheritance and doing
# everything in the ancestor version also.

# For a successful Minecraft launch, we want
# -cp: jars optained from version JSON
# -Dlog4j.configurationFile: whatever xml is under .minecraft/assets/log_configs but get correct answer from version JSON
# mainClass from version JSON
# --username, --version, --uuid, --accessToken from server
# --gameDir: /home/<username>/.minecraft
# --assetsDir: /home/<username>/.minecraft/assets
