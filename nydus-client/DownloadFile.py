Class theory

This class will include all the info needed to actually download a file used in Minecraft
This includes
  * The position on the filesystem where it should go
  * The expected sha1 hash of the file
  * The url at which the file will be found

The class will also have the utilities needed to download the file.
When file download is requested, we need to
    1) Check if the file already exists
    2) If it exists, check if it has the right sha1 hash. If so, we're done -> Success
    3) If it has the wrong hash or doesn't exist, check if the path to the file's location exists
    4) If the path doesn't exist, make it
    5) Download the file from the interwebs and place it in the right spot.
    6) Check the newly downloaded file has the right hash. If so, we're done -> Success

Possible (unrecoverable) error cases:
    * existing file is missing/wrong hash and
        - path to file's location can't be created
        - url doesn't exist
        - connection gets interrupted
        - location to write the file is unwritable
        - file downloads fine but has the wrong hash

Is there any reason to delay downloading the file?
Should the class download the file as soon as it is instantiated?
